### What does `BlockMode` field do?

By default, library lets you read and write values so we need a locker to make sure your data is safe. But in cases that you are very sure about only reading data through the library, you can set `cfg.BlockMode = false` to speed up read operations about **50-70%** faster.

### Why another INI library?

Many people are using my other INI library [goconfig](https://github.com/Unknwon/goconfig), so the reason for this one is I would like to make more Go style code. Also when you set `cfg.BlockMode = false`, this one is about **10-30%** faster.

To make those changes I have to confirm API broken, so it's safer to keep it in another place and start using `gopkg.in` to version my package at this time.(PS: shorter import path)
